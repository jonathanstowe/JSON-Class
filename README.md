# JSON::Class

A Role to allow Perl 6 objects  to be constructed and serialised from/to JSON.

## Synopsis

```

    use JSON::Class;

    class Something does JSON::Class {
 
        has Str $.foo;

    }

    my Something $something = Something.from-json('{ "foo" : "stuff" }');

    ...

    my Str $json = $something.to-json(); # -> '{ "foo" : "stuff" }'

```

## Description

This is a simple role that provides methods to instantiate a class from a
JSON string that (hopefully,) represents it, and to serialise an object of
the class to a JSON string.  The JSON created from an instance should
round trip to a new instance with the same values for the "public attributes".
"Private" attributes (that is ones without accessors,) will be ignored for
both serialisation and de-serialisation.  The exact behaviour depends on that
of (JSON::Marshal)[https://github.com/jonathanstowe/JSON-Marshal] and
(JSON::Unmarshal)[https://github.com/tadzik/JSON-Unmarshal] respectively.


If the ```:skip-null``` adverb is provided to ```to-json``` all attributes
without a defined value will be ignored in serialisation. If you need
finer grained control then you should apply the ```json-skip-null```
attribute trait (defined by ```JSON::Marshal``` ) to the traits you
want to skip if they aren't defined (```:json-skip``` will still have
the same effect though.)

The  (JSON::Marshal)[https://github.com/jonathanstowe/JSON-Marshal] and
(JSON::Unmarshal)[https://github.com/tadzik/JSON-Unmarshal] provide traits
for controlling the unmarshalling/marshalling of specific attributes which are
re-exported by the module.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working perl6 installation you should be able to
install this with *panda* :

    # From the source directory
   
    panda install .

    # Remote installation

    panda install JSON::Class

I haven't tested with "zef" but I can see no reason why it shouldn't
work equally well.
